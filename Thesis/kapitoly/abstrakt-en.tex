From observations of meteors we are able to determine the orbit of the meteorid. We then decide which meteor shower the observed meteor belongs to based on the orbital elements of this orbit. Several methods, collectively known as $D$-criteria, have been devised for this exact purpose. These are based on an orbital dissimilarity measure which is then compared with some fixed cutoff value. We describe the $D_\text{SH}$, $D_\text{D}$, $D_\text{H}$ and $D_\text{N}$ criteria and discuss their properties. Our findings are used in createion a software tool used to apply these criteria to real-world data.
